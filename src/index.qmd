# the<br/>Mind Science Philosophy Community<br/>@ UCSF

We are a group of scholars committed to promoting the **free investigation** of Mind.

This mostly involves watching interesting videos in the [Sandler Conference Center](https://ind.ucsf.edu/neuroscience-conference-center-nscc), and then talking about them over refreshments.
