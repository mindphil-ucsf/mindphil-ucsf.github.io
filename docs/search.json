But with the benefit of hindsight—and a recently-released Director’s Cut with tighter focus—contemporary critics have given the movie much more credit, both for its archetypical embodiment of 1980s popular media, and for its central themes of breaking free of past codes and standing as an individual against an apparently-insurmountable collective machine.
